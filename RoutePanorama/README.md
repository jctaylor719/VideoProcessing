+ Jupyter Notebook
+ Video/Image Processing

### Navigation

The ```Panoramas``` folder contains the final images generated from this project. They are panoramic views of the scenery seen from the left and right-side windows of a driving car. 

The ```Code``` folder includes the Jupyter source file, as well as a ```data``` folder, which was used to store the videos (in the nested ```videos``` folder) and the sliced frames (in the nested ```frames``` folder). There is currently nothing in these nested ```data``` folders, other than the Jupyter checkpoints. This is just because it would be a waste of storage. If you'd like to recreate this project, you can download the videos used [here](https://cs.iupui.edu/~jzheng/fun/M5/), and put them inside the ```videos``` folder. When running the FinalProject file, the ```frames``` folder will be populated with the sliced frames.

For more information about this project, I highly encourage you to read the documentation provided. Happy coding!
